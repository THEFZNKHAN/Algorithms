Here‚Äôs a **curated list of the best string questions on LeetCode** to master for JP Morgan‚Äôs Code for Good (and coding interviews). These cover all key patterns, including **sliding window, two pointers, hashing, palindromes, and dynamic programming**, with a focus on JP Morgan‚Äôs frequent topics:

---

### **1. Must-Solve String Categories & Top Questions**
#### **A. Sliding Window & Substrings**
1. **[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)**  
   - *Why*: Classic sliding window problem (JP Morgan loves this for optimizing time-series data).  
   - *Variants*: [Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-two-distinct-characters/).

2. **[Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)**  
   - *Why*: Tests substring optimization with hash maps (common in data filtering tasks).

---

#### **B. Two Pointers & Palindromes**
3. **[Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)**  
   - *Why*: Basic two-pointer logic (used in transaction ID validation).  
   - *Advanced*: [Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/).

4. **[Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)**  
   - *Why*: Tests dynamic programming or expand-around-center techniques (common in OAs).

---

#### **C. Hashing & Frequency Counting**
5. **[Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)**  
   - *Why*: Tests hash map + frequency counting (used in data categorization).  
   - *Similar*: [Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/).

6. **[First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)**  
   - *Why*: Simple but tests frequency map optimization.

---

#### **D. String Manipulation & Parsing**
7. **[String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)**  
   - *Why*: Tests edge-case handling (e.g., overflow, invalid characters).  
   - *JP Morgan Context*: Parsing financial data (e.g., transaction amounts).

8. **[Encode and Decode Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/)**  
   - *Why*: Tests serialization/deserialization (relevant for APIs in Code for Good projects).

---

#### **E. Dynamic Programming (Strings)**
9. **[Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)**  
   - *Why*: Classic DP problem (used in DNA matching, transaction reconciliation).  

10. **[Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)**  
    - *Why*: Tests DP for string transformations (e.g., data cleanup in banking systems).

---

#### **F. Greedy & Interleaving**
11. **[Interleaving String](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/)**  
    - *Why*: Tests DP or greedy logic (common in JP Morgan‚Äôs OA).  

12. **[Reorganize String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/)**  
    - *Why*: Tests greedy + heap usage (e.g., scheduling tasks).

---

### **2. JP Morgan-Specific String Patterns**
- **Financial Data Parsing**:  
  - [Valid Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/).  
  - *Why*: Validating numeric strings (e.g., currency inputs).  

- **Pattern Matching**:  
  - [Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/).  
  - *Why*: Tests bijective mapping (used in transaction pattern detection).  

- **Regular Expressions**:  
  - [Regular Expression Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/).  
  - *Why*: Advanced DP problem (relevant for data validation in fintech).

### **3. How to Practice**
- **Step 1**: Solve 5‚Äì10 questions daily (prioritize sliding window and two pointers).  
- **Step 2**: For JP Morgan, focus on **substrings**, **palindromes**, and **parsing problems**.  
- **Step 3**: Use the **LeetCode Discuss** tab for JP Morgan-specific solutions.

### **4. Pro Tips for JP Morgan**
1. **Edge Cases**: Test for empty strings, special characters, and Unicode.  
2. **Optimization**: Aim for O(n) time and O(1) space (e.g., using arrays instead of hash maps).  
3. **Real-World Context**: Frame answers around financial use cases (e.g., ‚ÄúThis regex solution could validate SWIFT codes‚Äù).  

---

### **Sample JP Morgan-Style Question**
**Problem**: *‚ÄúValidate if a string representing a transaction amount is a valid number (e.g., $1,000.50).‚Äù*  
**Solution**: Use deterministic finite automaton (DFA) or regex.  
**LeetCode Link**: [Valid Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/).

### **5. Study Plan for Strings (7 Days)**
- **Day 1-2**: Sliding Window (Longest Substring, Minimum Window).  
- **Day 3-4**: Two Pointers & Palindromes (Valid Palindrome, Longest Palindromic Substring).  
- **Day 5**: Hashing (Group Anagrams, First Unique Character).  
- **Day 6**: Parsing & Manipulation (String to Integer, Encode/Decode).  
- **Day 7**: DP (Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance).
