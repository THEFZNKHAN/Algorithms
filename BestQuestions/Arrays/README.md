Here‚Äôs a **curated list of the best array questions on LeetCode** to master for JP Morgan‚Äôs Code for Good (and most coding interviews). These questions cover all array patterns, from basics to advanced, with a focus on **JP Morgan‚Äôs frequent topics** like sliding window, two pointers, hashing, and dynamic programming:

---

### **1. Must-Solve Array Categories & Top Questions**
#### **A. Sliding Window & Subarrays**
1. **[Maximum Subarray (Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm)](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)**  
   - *Why*: JP Morgan loves Kadane‚Äôs algo for financial data (e.g., stock profit).  
   - *Variants*: [Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/).

2. **[Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)**  
   - *Why*: Tests deque/optimization skills (common in Code for Good‚Äôs time-series analysis).

3. **[Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)**  
   - *Why*: Classic sliding window for "sum ‚â• target" problems.

---

#### **B. Two Pointers**
4. **[Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)**  
   - *Why*: The #1 most asked array question at JP Morgan (hashmap or two pointers).

5. **[Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)**  
   - *Why*: Tests greedy two-pointer logic (used in optimization problems).

6. **[Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)**  
   - *Why*: Advanced two pointers/dynamic programming (frequent in OAs).

---

#### **C. Hashing & Frequency Counting**
7. **[Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)**  
   - *Why*: Tests prefix sum + hashing (common in financial data aggregation).

8. **[Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/)**  
   - *Why*: In-place hashing trick (JP Morgan likes space-efficient solutions).

---

#### **D. Matrix/2D Arrays**
9. **[Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)**  
   - *Why*: Tests in-place matrix manipulation (used in data cleanup scenarios).

10. **[Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)**  
    - *Why*: Pattern traversal (common in Code for Good‚Äôs grid-based problems).

---

#### **E. In-Place Operations**
11. **[Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)**  
    - *Why*: Matrix rotation is a classic problem (tests index mapping logic).

12. **[Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)**  
    - *Why*: Simple but tests in-place array modification.

---

#### **F. Dynamic Programming (Arrays)**
13. **[Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)**  
    - *Why*: Classic DP problem (JP Morgan uses it for time-series analysis).

14. **[Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)**  
    - *Why*: Tests greedy/DP logic (used in optimization for resource allocation).

---

### **2. JP Morgan-Specific Array Patterns**
- **Stock Buy/Sell Problems**:  
  - [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/) (and its variants I, II, III).  
  - *Why*: Directly relevant to financial roles at JP Morgan.

- **Interval Merging/Overlap**:  
  - [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/).  
  - *Why*: Used in scheduling/calendar systems (common in Code for Good projects).

- **Cyclic Arrays**:  
  - [Circular Array Loop](https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-array-loop/).  
  - *Why*: Tests cycle detection in financial transaction loops.

---

### **3. How to Practice**
- **Step 1**: Solve 5‚Äì10 questions daily (mix easy + medium).  
- **Step 2**: Time yourself (15‚Äì20 mins/question).  
- **Step 3**: For JP Morgan, focus on **Two Sum**, **Sliding Window**, and **Stock Problems** first.  
- **Step 4**: Use the **LeetCode Discuss** section to compare solutions (look for JP Morgan-tagged answers).

---

### **4. Pro Tips for JP Morgan**
1. **Edge Cases**: Always test for empty arrays, duplicates, and negative numbers.  
2. **Space Efficiency**: JP Morgan values O(1) space solutions (e.g., in-place array mods).  
3. **Real-World Context**: Frame your answers around finance (e.g., "This sliding window approach could optimize trading data analysis").  

---

### **Sample JP Morgan-Style Question**
**Problem**: *‚ÄúGiven daily stock prices, find the maximum profit from at most two transactions.‚Äù*  
**Solution**: Use dynamic programming to track buy/sell states.  
**LeetCode Link**: [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/).
