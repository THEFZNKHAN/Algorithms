### **Key Concepts to Master**  
- **Answer-space binary search**: When the problem asks for a **minimum/maximum valid value** (e.g., Kokoâ€™s bananas, ship packages).  
- **Pivot detection**: For rotated arrays (problems 33, 153).  
- **Range reduction**: Binary search on possible values, not indices (problems 378, 668).  
- **Template variations**:  
  - **Leftmost insertion**: `while (left < right)` with `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.  
  - **Conditional checks**: `nums[mid] >= target` vs. `nums[mid] > target` for first/last occurrence.

### **Workflow Recommendation**  
1. **Basics**: Start with 704, 35, 34.  
2. **Rotated arrays**: 33, 153, 154.  
3. **Answer-space**: 875, 410, 1482.  
4. **Matrix search**: 74, 240, 378.  
5. **Advanced**: 4 (median of arrays), 719 (pair distance).  
6. **Edge cases**: 81 (duplicates in rotated arrays), 154 (duplicates in min search).  

---

### **Common Pitfalls**  
- Infinite loops: Ensure loop termination with `left = mid + 1` or `right = mid`.  
- Off-by-one errors: Test edge cases like single-element arrays or targets outside the range.  
- Misapplying binary search: Not all problems with sorted arrays require binary search (e.g., some use two pointers).  

By solving these problems, youâ€™ll develop an intuition for when and how to apply binary search, even in non-traditional scenarios! ðŸš€
