Here‚Äôs a **curated list of essential graph traversal (BFS/DFS) questions on LeetCode** tailored for JP Morgan‚Äôs Code for Good and coding interviews. These questions cover all key patterns, including **shortest path, connectivity, topological sorting, and cycle detection**, with a focus on **finance-relevant use cases** like transaction networks, resource allocation, and social impact optimization:

### **1. Core BFS/DFS Patterns & Top Questions**
#### **A. Matrix/Grid Traversal (BFS for Shortest Path)**
1. **[Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)**  
   - *Pattern*: DFS/BFS for connected components.  
   - *Why*: Models financial network segmentation (e.g., detecting isolated transaction clusters).  

2. **[Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)**  
   - *Pattern*: Multi-source BFS (parallel propagation).  
   - *Why*: Simulates risk spread in financial systems (e.g., default cascades).  

3. **[Shortest Path in Binary Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)**  
   - *Pattern*: BFS with path cost tracking.  
   - *Why*: Used in optimizing transaction routing (e.g., payment gateways).  

---

#### **B. Tree/Graph Traversal (DFS for Backtracking)**  
4. **[Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)**  
   - *Pattern*: DFS/BFS with hash map for node mapping.  
   - *Why*: Tests deep copy logic (relevant for data replication in fintech).  

5. **[Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)**  
   - *Pattern*: Topological sorting (DFS/BFS for cycle detection).  
   - *Why*: Models task dependencies in Code for Good projects.  

6. **[All Paths From Source to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/)**  
   - *Pattern*: Backtracking DFS.  
   - *Why*: Finds all possible transaction paths (e.g., multi-hop payments).  

---

#### **C. Cycle Detection & Bipartite Graphs**  
7. **[Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)**  
   - *Pattern*: Topological sort with BFS (Kahn‚Äôs algorithm).  
   - *Why*: Orders tasks while detecting cycles (critical for project workflows).  

8. **[Is Graph Bipartite?](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/)**  
   - *Pattern*: BFS/DFS with coloring.  
   - *Why*: Tests graph partitioning (e.g., fraud detection in transaction networks).  

---

#### **D. Advanced BFS (Weighted Graphs)**  
9. **[Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)**  
   - *Pattern*: BFS with priority queue (Dijkstra-like).  
   - *Why*: Optimizes cost-limited paths (e.g., budget-constrained resource allocation).  

10. **[Network Delay Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/)**  
    - *Pattern*: Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm (BFS + heap).  
    - *Why*: Simulates latency minimization in payment networks.

### **2. JP Morgan-Specific Graph Patterns**  
- **Transaction Network Analysis**:  
  - [Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/).  
  - *Why*: Detects nodes not in cycles (e.g., identifying risky accounts).  

- **Social Impact Optimization**:  
  - [Minimum Knight Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/).  
  - *Why*: Models efficient resource delivery (e.g., disaster relief routing).  

- **Hierarchical Data Traversal**:  
  - [Employee Importance](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-importance/).  
  - *Why*: Tests BFS/DFS for nested structures (e.g., org charts in banking).

### **3. How to Practice**  
- **Step 1**: Solve **1 BFS + 1 DFS problem daily** (prioritize matrix traversal and topological sort).  
- **Step 2**: For Code for Good, practice [Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/) (social impact: optimizing aid distribution).  
- **Step 3**: Use **LeetCode‚Äôs graph visualizer** to debug adjacency lists.  

---

### **4. Pro Tips for JP Morgan**  
1. **Space Optimization**:  
   - Use iterative DFS (stack) to avoid recursion stack limits.  
   - For BFS, track visited nodes with a boolean array instead of a hash set.  

2. **Edge Cases**:  
   - Test for empty graphs, single-node graphs, and disconnected components.  

3. **Real-World Context**:  
   - Frame BFS as "optimizing shortest financial risk paths" and DFS as "exploring all project dependencies."
