/*
Problem Statement:  Here is about to introduce a new kind of number system. Where instead of 10 digits there is 20, from a to t, all in small. Now a means 1, b means 2 and t means 20, thenn aa means 21. Now for  a new number you have to print the decimal form it.
Note that the letters in the input string will be lower case and from a to t. 

Input Format:
Single line containing the string of new number systemâ€™s number

Output Format:
Single line denoting the integer with the same decimal value as the input string

Sample input 1: e
Sample Output: 5

Sample  Input 2: ac
Sample Output: 23
