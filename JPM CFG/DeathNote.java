/*
 * Problem Statement :
 * 
 * Ryuk, the Shinigami (God of death) had allowed Light Yagami, a school
 * student, to kill as many people as he can by using a death note. But writing
 * the names barely will allow other people to watch them. So he encrypts the
 * names using digits, where a means 1, b means 2 and so on upto z is 26. Now if
 * he gives numbers, there is a communication error because a number string can
 * be decrypted by the death note in various ways and eventually killing them
 * all. If everyone in the world has a unique name, for a given number, how many
 * people can die?
 * NOTE THAT: There is every possible name in the world with the 26 letters, and
 * capital or small letters is not a problem.
 * 
 * Input format:
 * A number stream denoting the first nameâ€™s encrypted version
 * 
 * Output Format:
 * Number of people dying by this.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1<=stream length<=10^8
 * 
 * Sample Input: 1267
 * Sample Output: 3
 * Output Specification:Two people of the name azg and lfg die.
