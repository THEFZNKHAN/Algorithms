## Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in computer science that store elements in a contiguous block of memory. They allow for efficient access to elements using an index.

### Introduction
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

### Basic Operations
- **Traversal**: Accessing each element of the array.
- **Insertion**: Adding an element at a specific index.
- **Deletion**: Removing an element from a specific index.
- **Search**: Finding the location of an element.
- **Update**: Changing the value of an element at a specific index.

### Common Problems
- **Two Sum**: Find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target.
- **Maximum Subarray**: Find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum.
- **Merge Intervals**: Merge overlapping intervals in an array.
- **Product of Array Except Self**: Find an array such that each element is the product of all elements in the original array except the one at the current index.
